finished up most of the prototype of the imgui for now. Buttons and sliders are in there; now I need to
get some nice textures for it. Tomorrow I'll work on the gameplay of the Tiny Wings clone.

Also, a couple more layouts would be nice to have, Java has some nice examples. FlowLayout, BorderLayout
and GridLayout to name a few. Got to find a nice way to incorporate that into the imgui though.

Now might be a good idea to look for a spline editor I can use to create level chunks. If it doesn't exist, I'll have to create one.

Started work on GUI (layout mostly)

Same as yesterday

Today, I worked mainly on terrain genetation

Created game concept for second game. Trying to fix Box2D build issues.

Worked on flexing my C++ muscles again. Implemented some noise functions for procedural 
content generation

Today I worked mainly on getting Box2D to play nice with the ECS I'm using. Getting 
to know C++ again is quite a challenge. It's noticeable that it's been about 2 years 
since I've written a game (or an engine for that matter).

Also, the ECS approach might not fit the terrain I am developing at the moment.

Currently I'm questioning if a spline based game is the way to go... There are no real editors
for it (i.e.: no standard like TMX for tile-based games for instance).

The trick with the splines is to make them interesting. Alto's Adventure seems to do 
a good job at that. Better than Tiny Wings any way...

Pehaps I should have a close look at that game.

I should start developing the second game in parallel, pinball should work quite nicely 
with TMX files as well.
