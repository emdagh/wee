Created game concept for second game. Also, Box2D alongside cmake / g++ is giving some weird behaviour..
Checking tomorrow. Tired now.

Worked on flexing my C++ muscles again. Implemented some noise functions for procedural 
content generation

Today I worked mainly on getting Box2D to play nice with the ECS I'm using. Getting 
to know C++ again is quite a challenge. It's noticeable that it's been about 2 years 
since I've written a game (or an engine for that matter).

Also, the ECS approach might not fit the terrain I am developing at the moment.

Currently I'm questioning if a spline based game is the way to go... There are no real editors
for it (i.e.: no standard like TMX for tile-based games for instance).

The trick with the splines is to make them interesting. Alto's Adventure seems to do 
a good job at that. Better than Tiny Wings any way...

Pehaps I should have a close look at that game.

I should start developing the second game in parallel, pinball should work quite nicely 
with TMX files as well.
