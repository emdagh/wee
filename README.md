## Build instructions
* Navigate to the folder where you cloned this repository
* `cd scripts`
* `./pup.sh`
* `cd ..`
* `mkdir build && cd build`

and run the following commands (respective of your OS)
### Linux
* `cmake ..`


### Windows
* `cmake .. -G"Visual Studio 15"` or whatever is your flavour of VS.

optionally, it appears possible to open CMake projects with VS nowadays, perhaps it's what the kids do; but I haven't delved into how to get that up and running. Do so at your own peril.
