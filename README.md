## Build instructions
* Navigate to the folder where you cloned thie repository
* Create a folder called `build`

and run the following commands (respective of your OS)
### Linux
* `cd build`
* `cmake ..`


### Windows
* `cd build`
* `cmake .. -G"Visual Studio 15"` or whatever is your flavour of VS.

optionally, it appears possible to open CMake projects with VS nowadays, perhaps it's what the kids do; but I haven't delved into how to get that up and running. Do so on your own peril.
